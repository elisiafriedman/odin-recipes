        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Butterfly chicken breasts to yeild 4 pieces.  Place breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound to 1/4-inch thin.  Place flour on a plate and dredge each breast on both sides in flour.
                <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Put chicken into the skillet and season tops with salt and pepper. Turn when nicely browned, about 4 minutes, and season again.  Cook second side until browned, about 4 minutes.  Transfer breasts to a plate, reserving skillet drippings.
                <li>Add wine and lemon juice to the skillet, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Simmer to reduce and thicken sauce, about 5 minutes more.  Add capers and pour sauce over chicken breasts on the plate.  Sprinkle with parsley.
